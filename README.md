## General disclaimer

Exercises and examples made for the Java and Object Oriented Programming course by NÃ©lio Alves.

In some exercises and examples, some messages are in portuguese and others in English because in this repository we follow NÃ©lio Alves commands throughout the course. 

All exercises was made by me. In some of them, I made exactly what NÃ©lio Alves taught and in others I prefer to test some features that exists in JavaScript and want to see if in Java I can do the same. For instance, NÃ©lio taught about If/else condition and I preferred to try ternary operator instead if/else. My intention here is to know all the possibilities that Java gives us.
